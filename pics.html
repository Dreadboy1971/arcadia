<P>You'll have to excuse the clarity of some of these shots.  I had a cheapie roll of 200 ASA film left over that someone gave me.  The roll jammed up half way through the photo shoot and I had a hell-of-a-time making my camera advance to each next frame.
  Consequently, the film broke during development and only about half of the shots came out.  I will post more screen shots when I get the next roll developed.  Sorry.</P>

<P>A screen shot of TMNT, I think.  None of the other pics turned out for some reason.  Maybe the lighting or something.  April 8, 1999 - I realize now that the shutter speed of the camera's lens was faster than the screen's 60HzI (30Hz) refresh, therefore chances are that you will end up with a blank picture of the screen more than 90% of the time.  What a waste of film!</P>
