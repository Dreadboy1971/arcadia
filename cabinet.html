</B><P>Finding a cabinet was a little tricky at first. I knew that if I was going to do this that just "any old cabinet" would not be sufficient. There were a few things I was looking for in particular:</P>
<OL>

<I><LI>Had to have a </FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#00ffff">landscape oriented screen</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">. (Portrait would be no good for reading text, displaying PC-based games, etc.)</LI>
<LI>Had to have </FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#00ffff">two joysticks</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">. (2 player games, Robotron, and Battle Zone were all in mind at the time.)</LI>
<LI>Had to have </FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#00ffff">six action buttons</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"> per player in addition to "1 Player" and "2 Player" buttons. (Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter II, etc. require at least six buttons to work, as well as many Super Nintendo games.)</LI>
<LI>Had to be in </FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#00ffff">working condition</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">. (Usually when you find a cabinet the picture tube is blown. I wanted to make use of the original tube for those big screen games, otherwise I wouldn’t of bothered and just played them on my computer upstairs.)</LI></OL>

</I><P>After looking through the local bargain finder newspaper on-line I found only one candidate: An original "<B>Pole Position</B>" cabinet. Hmmm… Alright, but needed to rip out the steering wheel and do too many modifications. Besides, the guy was asking CDN $600. Ouch! I think I’d rather upgrade my computer for that price.</P>
<P>After putting the idea out of my head for a few weeks so that I might prioritize my money in order to pay some bills I happened to come across a 1991 "<B>Street Fighter II</B>" cabinet in the Bargain Finder On-Line. The guy was asking $150 for it. By the time I read the ad it was over a week old. I figured there was no chance that it would still be around, but I phoned anyway just to check. "Yup. Still got it. Nope. Haven’t sold it," he responded. "Whoo-hoo! Can I come over and check it out?" "Sure." "Where do you live?" Only a couple of blocks away, from where I lived. Great. It worked fined when he "juiced" her up. Even had a homemade wooden slurpee/beer rack on the side he was gonna throw in to sweeten the deal too. Nonetheless, I gave him the cash next day and got a friend to help me move the bloody thing into my place with his truck. Heavy bastards those old cabinets! After swilling a few beers with Sig, the guy who helped me move it, I went out for the evening and forgot about it until next morning, which was Saturday.</P>
<P>Upon inspection of the guts inside the cabinet I closed up the back with a puzzled look on my face and figured I better call Terry.  Terry’s pretty handy with electronics and I was quite amazed with some of the little gizmos and gadgets he invented which were sitting in Rubbermaid containers in his garage.  (Like his Haloween robot costume with all the lights and buzzers from grade 5, or was it last year, Terry?)  I only got to grade 11 electronics before the program was canceled at my next school. I didn’t know how the hell Terry and I would get it working using PC guts instead of the <A HREF="graphics/jamma.gif">JAMMA</A> guts, (see JAMMA later under the "harness" section) but I was determined to make it work…</P>
