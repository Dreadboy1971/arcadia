<B><P>Here’s the scoop…</P>
<P><IMG SRC="graphics/madhack.gif"></P>
</B><P>One day I was checking out this "time-limited" shareware Xevious game for Windows 95 that a friend sent me. It was impressive, nostalgic, and pretty cool. Until of course the stupid time-limit kicks you out of the game. Hmmph! Waste of time, unless a guy can finish the game, or at least try. The same friend, <A HREF="graphics/terry.gif">Terry</A>, then sent me a program called MAME v0.29 and a zip file containing the original Xevious ROMs contents. OK. I tried it out. Wow! Just like the original. No "boom" when you bombed ground targets, though. What a drag. Oh well. Close enough, right? No.</P>
<P>After checking out a few sites I quickly realized that "emulators" were quite rampant all over the Internet. Cool. I tried some of my favourites like Spy Hunter, Super Pacman, Gunsmoke, Battle Zone, and Robotron and they were just like I remember. What a buzz. Reminds me of wasting thousands of quarters on trying to master those games when I was a kid.</P>
<P>My nephew even thought they were pretty cool even though some were new 6+ years before he was even born. It’s not "Sony Playstation" or anything, but the games were good and simple, usually. One day we were playing Track &amp; Field with two Gravis gamepads and realized that we couldn’t run very fast. Of course, this was due to the fact that the original IBM PC joystick port only had support for two sticks with two buttons or one stick with four buttons. We couldn’t play with the gamepads, so we smashed the hell out of my poor little keyboard until some of the keys broke off and flew out of their sockets! (Track &amp; Field requires fast slamming of the buttons to run faster.)</P>
<P>Even using one gamepad with four buttons was useless for games like Defender, Stargate, Spy Hunter, and several fighting games which require 5 or more buttons. Arrghh! So then what? OK. Drive over to the retail computer store and pick up a Gravis Gamepad Pro which sports 10 buttons. Whoo-hoo! Only thing is that none of the emulators supported it, natively, and not all emulators even support joystick input. If they did you had to go through a painful calibration process each time. No good. The Gravis Gamepad Pro was alright because it had a DOS TSR (terminate and stay resident) program which allowed you to map the joystick to keystrokes on the keyboard. Great. Except it didn’t work under MAME!</P>
<P>After living with all that, I was playing Ms. Pacman on my nice little 15" digital monitor and felt like I was a smurf or something. Exactly. 15" monitors just don’t cut it if you want that nostalgic feeling. Hmmm. "Not gonna buy a 21" monitor for $1,800 just so I can play video games. Still can’t smash my keyboard for Track &amp; Field."</P>
<P>"I think I’ll have to buy an upright arcade machine to put all this stuff into…"</P></FONT></BODY>
