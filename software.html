<P>ATTENTION: Please note that I <B><I><U>do</B> </I></U>own all of the following registered software that I have acquired over years of owning a company in the computer resale industry.  By no means do I recommend or endorse using pirated or illegal software.  It's just not worth it.  Buy it second-hand if you don't want to spend a whole lot of money.  There are many "second-hand" software dealers in major urban centres.  So do yourself a favour and get the real thing.  Hint: Manuals are really handy when you get in a jam.</P>
